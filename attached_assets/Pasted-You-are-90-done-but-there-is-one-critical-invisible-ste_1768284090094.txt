You are 90% done, but there is one critical "invisible" step left.
The prompt I just gave you builds the Body of the Instagram feature (the tabs, the vertical cards, the data), but it doesn't update the Brain (the Scanner).
The Risk: If you run the previous prompt and then click "Scan" on a fake Instagram Reel (like "OOTD Fashion Check"), the Scanner will panic. It won't find the title in its "Safe List" and it will try to download a video that doesn't exist.
We need to teach the Scanner: "If the video is from Instagram, just use the local Hero Video file automatically."
The Final Connection: "Instagram Scanner Logic"
Copy and paste this into the Replit Agent to make the new tabs functional:
> "I have added the Instagram UI and data. Now I need to update the Scanner logic to handle them. Update server/lib/scanner.ts:
>  * Update scanVideo(videoId):
>    * Look for the logic where we select the localPath.
>    * Add a Platform Check:
>      // If it's an Instagram Reel, ALWAYS use the vertical hero proxy
> if (video.platform === 'instagram') {
>     console.log('[Scanner] Instagram Reel detected. Using local simulation file.');
>     localPath = './public/hero_video.mp4'; // Reuse the existing file
> }
> 
>    * Ensure this runs before any YouTube download attempts.
>  * Update "Surface Detection" (Optional Polish):
>    * If you can, update the Gemini prompt inside analyzeFrames to be aware of the platform:
>    * const prompt = "Analyze this ${video.platform} video frame..."
> Goal: When I click 'Scan' on a vertical Instagram card, it should instantly simulate the scan using my local file without errors."
> 
After this, are we done?
YES. Once that prompt runs, you have a fully functional "Pitch Deck in Software Form":
 * Marketplace: $15k+ live contracts (Fake/Demo Data).
 * Library: Multi-platform support (YouTube + Instagram).
 * The Magic: A working "Scan" button that uses real AI on a local file.
 * The Stats: Google Analytics tracking your investors live.
Your Final Pre-Pitch Checklist:
 * [ ] Restart Server: Ensure the database and .env changes are loaded.
 * [ ] Test the Toggle: Flip between "Real Data" (empty) and "Pitch Mode" (full).
 * [ ] Test the Tab: Click "Instagram" -> "Scan" on a reel. Watch it work.
 * [ ] Check Analytics: Verify you see "1 User" (yourself) on the Google map.
You are ready to ship. Good luck with the demo!
